# YouTube View Algorithm Cracker👨‍💻
This program was my one of my personal side projects when I was back in high-school. I hope you will enjoy it.

## Requirements:
- Install **python3** on your computer🐍
- Install Selenium package, if you don't have📦
- Download **Chrome** Web Browser🌐
- **RAM** = 16GB, to run smoothly💻
- High-Speed INTERNET or WIFI connection🔥

## How to Use?
- After installing the required files and packages open your code editor and run the python file. Then enter the number of drivers(tabs), video url(the targeted video you want to use), and refresh rate() you wanna use.
- Boom! Sit back and enjoy while your video view counts...🚀
- ctrl+c to stop the process.
- Because Chrome uses more RAM make sure that you have enough unless the program might crash your pc and/or damage it.
- Sign-out all of your emails from Chrome Web Browser before starting the program.
